      <h3>German Shepherd</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the
      <mark> German Shepherd Dog</mark> is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble
      character and high intelligence.<span> <em>lover's delight</em> </span>.
      German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and,
      when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves
      rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can
      turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons
      why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but
      experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage,
      confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the
      willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German
      Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the
      breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend
      itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.'¬ù
